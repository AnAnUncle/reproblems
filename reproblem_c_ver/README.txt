This is a C implementation of the RE test problem set. For details, please refer to the following paper:

Ryoji Tanabe, Hisao Ishibuchi, "An Easy-to-use Real-world Multi-objective Problem Suite" (submitted)

For the sake of simplicity, the name of each RE problem does not include the number of decision variables (e.g., RE2-4-1 => RE21). The source code was implemented by Ryoji Tanabe (rt.ryoji.tanabe [at] gmail.com, https://ryojitanabe.github.io/). The source code can be compiled by GCC 5.4.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. If you have any troubles, please let him know.

# How to run the program

Please compile "reproblem.c" and run its executable file. The objective values of a randomly generated solution on the RE21 problem are shown in the default setting.
