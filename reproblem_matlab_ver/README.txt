This is a Octave/Matlab implementation of the RE test problem. For details, please refer to the following paper:

Ryoji Tanabe, Hisao Ishibuchi, "An Easy-to-use Real-world Multi-objective Problem Suite" (submitted)

For the sake of simplicity, the name of each RE problem does not include the number of decision variables (e.g., RE2-4-1 => RE21). The source code was implemented by Ryoji Tanabe (rt.ryoji.tanabe [at] gmail.com, https://ryojitanabe.github.io/). The source code can be carried out with Octave 4.0.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, so he thinks that it also works well with Matlab on any OS. If you have any troubles, please let him know.

# How to run the program

Please run "main.m". The objective values of a randomly generated solution on the RE21 problem are shown in the default setting.
